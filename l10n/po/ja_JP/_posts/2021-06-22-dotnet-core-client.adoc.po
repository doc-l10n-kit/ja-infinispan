msgid "Our current .NET client is based on the {cpp} core implementation, which is a solution that has its pros and cons.  It makes it easier to guarantee parity between the {cpp} and C# clients over the time, but has the drawback of tying clients to specific a architecture.  In turn that complicates portability and distribution, making the release lifecycle for those clients more onerous and sluggish."
